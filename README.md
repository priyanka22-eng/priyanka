This project is a Java Full-Stack Credit Card Fraud Detection System that combines machine learning with modern web technologies to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. The backend is built using Java with Spring Boot to handle RESTful APIs, data processing, and business logic, while the frontend is developed with React/Angular to provide an intuitive user interface for monitoring transactions. The system integrates with a relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL) to store transaction records securely, and machine learning models are used to analyze transaction patterns and classify them as legitimate or fraudulent. The application workflow covers user authentication, transaction management, fraud detection analysis, and visualization of results through dashboards. Emphasis is placed on recall and accuracy to minimize false negatives in fraud detection, ensuring reliability in real-world scenarios. The project leverages tools like Maven/Gradle for dependency management, JPA/Hibernate for ORM, and follows MVC architecture for scalability and maintainability. Future enhancements include deploying the model as a microservice, integrating real-time streaming with Kafka, and hosting the application on cloud platforms for production-ready fraud detection solutions.
