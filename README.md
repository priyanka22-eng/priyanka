This project is a Java Full-Stack Credit Card Fraud Detection System designed to secure online transactions and prevent unauthorized card usage. The backend is implemented using Java Servlets, JSP, and JDBC for business logic and database connectivity, while the frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an interactive user interface. The system connects with MySQL/PostgreSQL databases to store and validate transaction details securely. Fraud prevention logic ensures that if an unauthorized person attempts to use a card, the system records failed attempts and automatically blocks the card after the third failed attempt. This feature simulates real-world scenarios such as stolen cards, enhancing security and reliability. The application also provides role-based access for customers and administrators, enabling users to perform transactions and admins to monitor and manage suspicious activities. It follows MVC architecture for scalability and maintainability, ensuring a structured and robust solution. Future enhancements include OTP verification, encryption of sensitive data, and deployment on cloud platforms for real-time scalability.
